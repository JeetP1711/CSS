    <p class="eco">A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.</p>
    <h1>Types Of Selectors: </h1>
    <ol class="eco">
        <li>Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</li>
        <li>Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</li>
        <li>Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)</li>
        <li>Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)</li>
        <li>Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="eco">Right now we will only learn about basic simple selectors.</p>
    <pre class="eco">
        Styling the elements in different ways and through different ways:
        1. Selecting by name:
        p{
            styles here.....
        }
        This p is a direct element from the html file.
        <!-- This i the direct selector aka by name -->
        2. Selecting by id:
        #parol{
            styles here.....
        }
        This is the id selector from the file, which selects the element with id = "<b>parol</b>".
        <!-- This will select the element with the id parol and will style it. -->
        <!-- The "#" is used to select the id in any and from anywhere in html css and js. -->
        3. Selecting by Class:
        .eco{
            styles here.....
        }
        This is the class selector from the file, which selects the element/s with class ="<b>eco</b>"
        <!-- This will select the element/s with the class eco and style it. -->
        <!-- The "." is used to select the class in any and from anywhere in html, css and, js -->
        4. Selecting specific class element:
        p.eco{
            styles here.....
        }
        This will just select the paras with class "<b>eco</b>".
        <!-- This will just select the paras with eco and not any other thing or element. -->
        <!-- The tagname.class is written for selection of elements like this. -->
        5. Universal Selector:
        *{
            styles here.....
        }
        This will select all the elements of the file.
        <!-- "*" is used to select all the elements from the file in css and js. -->

        6. Grouping Selector:
        h1, p, pre{
            styles here.....
        }
        This will select the elements from h1, p and pre.
        <!-- The "," are used to select different elements from the file. -->
    </pre>
