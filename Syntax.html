    <pre>Like here we can see....
        h1 is the selector and the declarations are:
        color: red;
        <!-- Here color is the property and red is the value of color -->
        text-align: center;
        <!-- Here text-align is the property and center is the value of it -->
    </pre>
    <pre>
        The selector element is used to select the specific element from the html which we need to style. And how to style that. Like h1 here is the selector for the style.
        h1{
            color: red;
            text-align: center;
        }
        h1-> selector
        color-> properties
        text-align-> properties
        red-> value
        center-> value

        There are a tons of properties to change in the css styles and make it good looking and better.
        Values are those which we use in the specific properties like red is the color property and center is the text-align property.
        Selector is the element from the html file which we want to style from the particular.
